xii PREFA GE.

Providence, is slow. She waits for that majestic course to
perfect in its own good time, what she cannot extort from it;
for the gradual drifting of precious things upon her shore, now
one and now another, out of which she may complete her
rosary and enrich her beads,-beads and rosary more pure
and true than those which at the command of duty she flung
away.

As far as we khow, the public Hyrnns os the early Church
were not much more than the following. First, starting ftom
scripture, she adopted the repetition of the Hallelujab, which
tedescribed by St. John, in the Revelations‚ to be the chant of
the blessed inhabitants of heaven. Next may be mentioned
the Gloria Patri, pretty much as welnow use it. Thirdly, the
Trisogion, or “ Holy, Holy, Holy,” from Isaiah vi.; or, as it
was also used, and now is, in the Roman Choreb, “ Sanctus
Deus, Sanctus Fortis, Sanctus Immortalis.” Besides these,
there was the Monung or Angelic Hymn, beginning with ‚the
words used by the Angels at the nativity; and for the evening
the Hymn beginning “ Hail gladdening Light,'' preserved by
St. Basil. These are not metrical, as they were afterwards;
nor are two others of a later date, which we still retain, the
Te Deum 'and the Athanasion Oreed. They are both of Gal·

lican origin, though the former has been ascribed to St. Am·

brose. Others, however, now extant, are certainly his ; others

are the compositions of St. Hilary, Prudentius, St. Gregory,
